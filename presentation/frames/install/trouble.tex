	\begin{itemize}
		\item Keep your calm and search for the origin of your error.
		\item Use the information you've got to search for solutions with a search engine of your choice.
		\item Most likely someone else already had the same problem.
		\item Wikis are a great source for help
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \url{https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/}
				\item \url{https://wiki.archlinux.org/}
			\end{itemize}
		\item Mailing lists can also contain valuable information.
		\item Ask people you know with some knowledge of Linux.
		\item Only clear the cache of your package manager when you're sure everything works. You might need the older versions of packages stored there.
		\item And don't forget: \textbf{Make regular backups!}
