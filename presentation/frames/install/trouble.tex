		\begin{itemize}
			\item Most likely someone else already had the same problem. So throw the information you've got about the error into a search machine of your choice.
			\item Wikis are a great source for help
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \url{https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/}
				\item \url{https://wiki.archlinux.org/}
			\end{itemize}
			\item Mailing lists can also contain valuable information.
			\item Ask people you know with some knowledge of Linux.
			\item Only clear the cache of your package manager when you're sure everything works. You might need the older versions of packages stored there.
