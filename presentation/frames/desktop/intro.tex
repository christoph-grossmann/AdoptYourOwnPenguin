	\subsection{Some information}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Desktop environments are separate from operating systems
		\item Most distributions have a wide array of available desktops
		\item If a distribution doesn't support your preferred desktop, you might still be able to install it by hand
		\item Unlike Windows and macOS, Linux desktops are far more customizable
		\item Choose a desktop that fits your needs and try to work with it (don't switch as soon as something doesn't work or look exactly as you'd like)
		\item Desktop Chooser\cite{desktopchooser} (sadly not as good as the Distro Chooser): \url{https://www.knetfeder.de/linux/linux-desktop-chooser/}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{alertblock}{Remember it's not permanent!}
		You can easily install another desktop, either keeping the previous one or removing it.
