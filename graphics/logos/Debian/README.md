# Debian logos

Debian has two logos. The official logo (also known as "open use logo") contains the well-known Debian "swirl" and best represents the visual identity of the Debian Project. A separate, restricted-use logo, also exists for use by the Debian Project and its members only. To refer to Debian, please prefer the open use logo.

## Debian Open Use Logo

The Debian Open Use Logo comes in two flavors, with and without “Debian” label.
